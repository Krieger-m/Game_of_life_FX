visualization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game-of-life</a> cellular 
automaton.  
  
this project is built using JavaFX  
  
The rules: 
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
